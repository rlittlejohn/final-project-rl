<h1>Final Project</h1>

<h2>Project name: CowLoop</h2>

<h3>By: Rachel Littlejohn</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
    <li>Application Overview: </li>
        <pre>
            My application will draw a cow using shapes, colors, and cordinates.
        </pre>
    <li>Technology Overview:</li>
        <pre>
            Using Python and TurtleDraw I will create an application that reads data 
            from coordinates I create and then draws graphical lines and shapes based on the data.
        </pre>
    <li>Proposal Last Updated (the date the proposal was last updated)</li>
        <pre>
            December 15, 2022
        </pre>
    <li>Feature List (prioritized list of features that can likely be delivered in the time allowed)
        <pre>
            I will create a application that includes colors, cordinates, and has the right coding to draw shapes.
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>Future Feature List</li>
        <pre>
           Added a click to close option.
        </pre>
    <li>Basic Technical Features (list of technical features being implemented that demonstrates things you have learned in the class)</li> 
        <pre>
            Use my ability to research to teach myself ways to formulate shapes in       
        </pre>
    <li>Advanced Technical Features:</li> 
        <pre>
           I have to configure my own shapes and colors with coordinates to design a cow in TurtleDraw, I have not done this
           on my own yet. So, it will take research as well as trial and error to learn and develop this application on my own.     
        </pre>
